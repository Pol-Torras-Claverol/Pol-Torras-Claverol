## Hi there 👋

I am a first-year student of Multiplatform Application Development (DAM), currently learning Java and C#. I previously completed a vocational training degree in Microcomputer Systems and Networks (SMIR), where I built a strong technical base in computing, systems, and networking.

I am focused on improving my programming skills through personal projects, mainly small console applications in Java. My goal is to strengthen my logic, code structure, and problem-solving abilities while preparing for future professional opportunities.

At the moment, I am:

Developing console applications in Java

Learning the fundamentals of C#

Practicing programming logic with arrays, loops, conditions, and methods

Building a personal GitHub portfolio for internships and junior opportunities

In my free time, I work with 3D modeling and animation using Blender, and I have experience with Unreal Engine 4 and 5, as well as Unity in both 2D and 3D. These interests help me stay motivated, creative, and technically curious.
